Homegear
========
Homegear is a free and open source program to interface your HomeMatic BidCoS and Wired devices with your home automation software (like IP-Symcon, openHAB, etc.) or your own control scripts. Homegear fully replaces the CCU. It communicates with the home automation devices directly, enabling features not available by default. It implements the same XML-RPC (XML Remote Procedure Call) interface and supports the same set of methods as the HomeMatic central or the BidCoSÂ® service. Because of this you can use any software or script that supports the HomeMatic XML-RPC interface to control Homegear.
