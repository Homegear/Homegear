- Central: Pairing by serial
- Device: Pairing by serial
- Central: Is configuration sent to device after inserting batteries? / Handle device start up
- Device: Don't allow pairing to two masters
- Peer.cpp - getDeviceDescription: Add GROUP
- Peer.cpp - getLinks: Process flag GL_FLAG_GROUP
- Check device type and serial number on repairing
- RPC Server/Central: paramset_defs
- RPC Server: Store sysinfo and handle count_from_sysinfo
- Correctly use linksCentral: One paramset for each linked peer.
- Support for serial numbers in putParamset and getParamset
- Delete peer from all devices it is linked to, when peer is reset

Today:
- Peer.cpp: getLink - Add parameter sets
- Implement putParamset for link parameter set
- Mutexmap in BidCoSPacketmanager to avoid erasing packet and accessing it at the same time. Maybe also for BidCoSQueue
- Implement enforce:
