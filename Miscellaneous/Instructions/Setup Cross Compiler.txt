- Follow instructions here: http://airwiki.ws.dei.polimi.it/index.php/Cross-compiling_for_the_RaspberryPi
- You can ignore the copying of the libraries and the cmake part of the howto
- Create a Raspbian debootstrap environment in "/debootstrap/Raspbian" with all necessary libraries
- Change into $HOME/raspberrypi/tools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc
- Move usr to usr.bak and lib to lib.bak
- Create a softlink "usr" from the usr directory of the debootstrap environment and a softlink "lib" from the lib directory of the bootstrap environment
- Link /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf of the bootstrap environment to /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf and /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf of the bootstrap environment to /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf
- Now makeRPIDebug.sh and makeRPIRelease.sh should work

When libraries are not found, this helps:
cd into the Homegear source dir and type:
./premake4 --platform=rpi gmake
strace -f -o /tmp/strace.out -- make config=release_rpi

Then open /tmp/strace.out and search for the libraries which cause problems.
